Methodology:
"Rates are per 100,000."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA). See  SEER Race Recode Documentation for American Indian/Alaskan Native Statistics [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#ai-an]."
"Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Incidence data for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are based on the NAACCR Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm (NHIA) and exclude cases from the Alaska Native Registry. See SEER Race Recode Documentation for Spanish-Hispanic-Latino Ethnicity [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#hispanic]."
