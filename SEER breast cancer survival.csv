"Data Source:"
"SEER 18 areas [http://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html] (San Francisco, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, Atlanta, San Jose-Monterey, Los Angeles, Alaska Native Registry, Rural Georgia, California excluding SF/SJM/LA, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Georgia excluding ATL/RG)."
Methodology:
"The five-year survival rates are calculated using monthly intervals."
"The Expected Survival Life Tables [https://seer.cancer.gov/expsurvival/] by Socio-Economic Standards were used."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA). See  SEER Race Recode Documentation for American Indian/Alaskan Native Statistics [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#ai-an]."
"Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Incidence data for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are based on the NAACCR Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm (NHIA) and exclude cases from the Alaska Native Registry. See SEER Race Recode Documentation for Spanish-Hispanic-Latino Ethnicity [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#hispanic]."
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"See <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/explorer/cancer-sites.html"">SEER*Explorer Cancer Site Definitions</a> for details about the coding used for SEER Incidence data."
